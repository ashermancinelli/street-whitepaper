\section{Audience}

    This work targets churches in Spokane with a biblical understanding of the Gospel's call for the church to engage and come alongside the poor.
    I do not attempt here to provide an exhaustive theology of social justice, but rather the specific steps that local churches in Spokane can take to better care for the needy.
    This is intended for congregations that understand the need to engage with the poor, but perhaps lack the information or experience to carry it out.
    Note that all Bible passages are from the English Standard Version\cite{esv2016}.

\section{Intended Results}

    All team members should be equipped in the following capacities:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Preparing and distributing items for physical aid
        \item Sharing the gospel
        \item Praying with/for the served
        \item Deescalating conversations with upset people
        \item Developing relationships with those being served
    \end{enumerate}

    Leaders should be equipped in the following additional capacities:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Navigating the streets and leading teams on foot
        \item Leading and comforting team members coming for the first time
        \item Equipping others to lead in the same capacities
    \end{enumerate}

\section{Implementation}

This section describes the steps that the local church can take to achieve the goals previously outlined.

\section{Concluding Notes}

    \qChristianHedonism
    I have attempted to show (1) where the church in Spokane is presently lacking in service to the poor, (2) what it looks like for the church to grow in those areas, and (3) the steps we can take to get from (1) to (2).
    This growth is not emotionless, however.
    Christ is faithful to provide us with surpassing joy and satisfaction in Him when we obey His word, and service to the poor is no exception.
    I encourage each local church in Spokane to engage with the poor of our community no matter how uncomfortable it may be.
    \par \textbf{Uncover the treasures of joy in store for those faithful to live out the Gospel.}
