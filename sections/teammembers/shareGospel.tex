\subsubsection{Sharing the Gospel}

    % all of this falls apart when it is not hung on the same foundation
    % the gospel is central to all of this and there is no separating this from the gospel

    The most capable entity in equipping believers to know and share the Gospel is the local church.
    The local church should equip its members to know and share the Gospel by biblical teaching from the pulpit, and through members teaching each other.
    Each member of a team going downtown ought be a member or attendee of a local church that professes Christ and teaches biblical doctrine, enabling the member to articulate the Gospel.
    This is a great opportunity for more mature members of the Body of Christ to model to the younger ones how to share the Gospel.
    Particularly, parents have the opportunity to show their children how to share the Gospel, a skill that may translate to their schools and eventually their workplaces.
