\subsubsection{Developing Relationships}

    It is in the context of relationship that the Holy Spirit seems to do the most work.
    \footnote{Matthew 18:20}
    In living out the Gospel, we as the Church seek not to simply distribute food to people, we seek to love them and forge relationships with them.
    This does not happen in a single day, but over weeks, months, and years.
    By going downtown many times, each team member ought to get to know and pray for specific people.
    This means remembering names and details about those we serve, with the intention of forming long-term relationships.
    Writing down names and praying over specific people, whether individually or in community, is a great way to remember details from interactions.
    This is builds relationships because remembering the names of people and details about them is indicative of intentionality and genuine care for the person.
    \editonlyfn{Editors: The previous two sentences were in the ``Prayer'' section, but was moved here. Is this the best place for it? How can this thought also be incorporated in the prayer section?}
    Referring to a person by his or her name and remembering information about them carries a special significance, especially when this demographic is often treated as sub-human.
