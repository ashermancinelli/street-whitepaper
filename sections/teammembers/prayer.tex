\subsubsection{Prayer}

    In my experience, one of the methods of sharing the Gospel that has met the least friction is prayer.
    For example, ``Father in heaven, I thank you for your Gospel, which is\dots'' with a subsequent articulation of the Gospel.
    Prayer opens up a window for sharing the Gospel and is an opportunity to bring someone's needs to the Father, and every team member should be comfortable in praying with and for people they meet.
