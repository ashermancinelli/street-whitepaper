    \textit{
    By equipping the saints to lead and minister to people experiencing homelessness, especially queer people, in the context of Spokane, Washington, we as the Church will better live out the Gospel.
    The local church's ministry to queer people experiencing homelessness in Spokane is best accomplished by small teams with one leader, working in coordination with other long-term organizations (e.g. Union Gospel Mission\footnote{https://www.uniongospelmission.org/}, the House of Charity\footnote{https://www.cceasternwa.org/}, etc) already at work.
    The local church should not contribute to systemic problems or hinder the work of full-time ministries, but should contribute to the work of long-term organizations.
    The local church should apply its financial resources to tend to the poor in our city\footnote{Acts 2:42-47}, and its knowledge of the Gospel to bring more people into a saving knowledge of Christ\footnote{Matthew 28:18-20}.
