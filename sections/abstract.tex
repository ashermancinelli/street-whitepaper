    % LF: local church not contributing to systemic problems, not hindering other groups already at work
    % LF: maybe give more information about other groups working in the area, give other resources for how to go about This
    % LF: If there is any part of this that is lacking, it is where the church is falling short
    \textit{
    By equipping the saints to lead and minister in the context of Spokane, Washington, we as the Church will better live out the Gospel.
    The local church's ministry to the homeless and food-insecure in Spokane is best accomplished by small teams with one leader, working in coordination with other long-term organizations (e.g. Union Gospel Mission\footnote{https://www.uniongospelmission.org/}, the House of Charity\footnote{https://www.cceasternwa.org/}, etc) already at work.
    The local church should not contribute to systemic problems or hinder the work of full-time ministries, but should contribute to the work of long-term organizations.
    The local church should apply its financial resources to tend to the poor in our city, and its knowledge of the Gospel to bring more people into a saving knowledge of Christ.
