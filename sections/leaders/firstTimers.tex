\subsubsection{Leading First-Timers}

    Before breaking into teams, I find it is helpful to recap three points: our motivation (the gospel), past experience (how the ministry has looked in the past), and the plan (what it will look like today).
    When leading someone downtown who has never gone before, it is extremely helpful and reassuring to describe to them what typically happens and what the plan for that day is.
    Even if they seem comfortable, they may need some encouragement to feel ready to talk to people or hand out food.
    For example, as the leader you may begin an interaction with somebody and invite the newcomer into the conversation, or ask them to give some food to someone in particular to get them started.
    Encouragement, reassurance, and gratitude go a long way in making a team member feel comfortable sharing and speaking with people on the streets.
    Additionally, leaders may provide more information to first-timers to help contextualize what they see downtown.
    For example, they may help the first-timer understand that around one-third to two-fifths of the people they will meet will be queer.
