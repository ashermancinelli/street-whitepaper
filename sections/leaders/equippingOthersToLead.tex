\subsubsection{Equipping Others to Lead}

    Leading is the best way to equip another person to lead.
    Especially if someone has participated several times before, it may be helpful to let that individual carry the food/goods and handle most of the interactions with people.
    This will boost their confidence and make them feel comfortable, while you stay close by and encourage their interactions.
    The mark of a truly experienced leader is their ability to empower others to lead---in the same way, a leader downtown ought to bring up other capable leaders from within their team.
