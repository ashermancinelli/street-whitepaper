\section{Concluding Notes}

    \qChristianHedonism
    I have attempted to show (1) where the church in Spokane is presently lacking in service to the poor, (2) what it looks like for the church to grow in those areas, and (3) the steps we can take to get from (1) to (2).
    This growth is not emotionless, however.
    Christ is faithful to provide us with surpassing joy and satisfaction in Him when we obey His word, and service to the poor is no exception.
    I encourage each local church in Spokane to engage with the poor of our community no matter how uncomfortable it may be.
    \par \textbf{Uncover the treasures of joy in store for those faithful to live out the Gospel.}
