\subsection{Leaders}

    The responsibilities of team leaders exceed that of the other team members.
    Volunteers should be made aware that they may be subjected to hateful opinions, such as misogyny, prejudice based on sexuality, and racism.
    Occasionally, residents and people on the streets may speak or act out in such a way that volunteers, specifically women, are uncomfortable.
    \editonlyfn{Editors: How do I make explicit the need for male leaders and the gender specific considerations of leaders?}
    Volunteer teams tend to feel more comfortable and interactions tend to stay more appropriate when there is at least one man on any team, and leaders should ensure this is the case.
