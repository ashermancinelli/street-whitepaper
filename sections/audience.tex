\section{Audience}

    This work targets churches in Spokane with a biblical understanding of the Gospel's call for the church to engage and come alongside the poor.
    I do not attempt here to provide an exhaustive theology of social justice, but rather the specific steps that local churches in Spokane can take to better care for the needy.
    This is intended for congregations that understand the need to engage with the poor, but perhaps lack the information or experience to carry it out.
    Note that all Bible passages are from the English Standard Version\cite{esv2016}.
