\begin{abstract}
    \textit{
    By equipping the saints to lead and minister in the context of downtown Spokane, we as the Church may better live out the Gospel.
    The local church's ministry to the homeless and food-insecure in Spokane, Washington is best accomplished by small teams with one leader, working in coordination with other long-term organizations already at work.
    The local church should not contribute to systemic problems or hinder the work of full-time ministries, but should contribute to the work of long-term organizations.
    The local church should use its financial resources to tend to the poor, and its knowledge of the Gospel to bring more people into a saving knowledge of Christ.

\section{Problems}

    In my experience with local churches, organizations and individuals in Spokane, there are many elements that hinder those organizations and individuals from feeding and ministering to the poor, however not all of them will be addressed here.
