\begin{abstract}
    \textit{
    By equipping the saints to lead and minister in the context of downtown Spokane, we as the Church may better live out the Gospel.
    The local church's ministry to the homeless and food-insecure in Spokane, Washington is best accomplished by small teams with one leader, working in coordination with other long-term organizations already at work.
    The local church should not contribute to systemic problems or hinder the work of full-time ministries, but should contribute to the work of long-term organizations.
    The local church should use its financial resources to tend to the poor, and its knowledge of the Gospel to bring more people into a saving knowledge of Christ.

    \textbf{The Church:} All those who have trusted in Christ for salvation, and who are incorporated into the Body of Christ by the Holy Spirit, spanning all time and space
    \and \textbf{The Local Church:} The local church is a group of believers in a given area who are organized under leadership, and who regularly gather together to carry out the mission of the church
    \and \textbf{The Gospel:} That all humanity was separated from God by sin, but is overcome by the faith of an individual in Christ and his saving work to overcome the debt of sin, bringing that individual into communion with God and into continued sanctification and conformation into the image of Christ

\section{Problems}

    In my experience with local churches, organizations and individuals in Spokane, there are many elements that hinder those organizations and individuals from feeding and ministering to the poor, however not all of them will be addressed here.
    The four problems to be addressed are as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Feeling of insufficiency in ministering on the streets
        \item Lack of volunteers that feel equipped to lead
        \item Leaders ill-equipped to watch for the safety of the team
        \item Teams ill-equipped to share the Gospel
    \end{itemize}

    %    Common problems that will \textit{not} be addressed here are as follows:
    %    \begin{itemize}
    %        \item Lack of motivation to minister to the homeless
    %        \item 
    %    \end{itemize}
