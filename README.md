# Street Ministry

This is the repository for all my documents pertaining to the coordination of the efforts of organizations and churches in Spokane to fight homelessness.
There are two documents which contain the same content, but formatted differently.

[This](arxiv.pdf) is the more formally formatted document, and [this](vanilla.pdf) is formatted more like a whitepaper.

[This](handout.pdf) is the handout used at the most recent meeting.
