# Street Ministry

This is a branch of the original street ministry paper, altered for my LGBT Studies course.
This is tuned to the needs and interactions between service organizations and the LGBT homeless population.

[This](arxiv.pdf) is the more formally formatted document, and [this](vanilla.pdf) is formatted more like a whitepaper.
